If - after startup - the programmer does not work because it receices a long
long invalid return message (nothing intelligable really), then proceed as follows:

(usb cable must be attached)

1. open terminal
2. type screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600
	a black screen is shown
3. type Ctrl+a, then k, then y (when some question comes up)

Now it should work.
